Liquid 	2.4.0 (ymesh)

- merged last sources from duran-duboi branch

Liquid 	2.3.6b (ymesh)

- liquidAttributeManager.mel replaces a tree of menu for liquid attributes attachment/detachment.
- build configuration files moved to $LIQUIDHOME/build directory
- zlibwapi.dll (1.2.5) is needed if linking with generic ribLib 
- Fixed code for nurbs surfaces with pt.w != 1 
- String variable $TEX for texture file extension from Render Globals
- .textureExt attribute in liquidGlobals
- .shadowMainCamera attribute in liqLightNode allows to specify alternative camera for shadow
  generation (instead of maya defauly lightsource camera)
- in liqGlobalHelpers.cpp added a set of functions "liquidGetPlugElementValue" for different value types
  (The purpose is to reduce and unify code for reading secondary displays and display channels attributes)     
- "generateShadowArchiveName" replaced by call to "generateFileName" with case "fgm_shadow_archive"
- code for setting RenderLayer moved from "liqRibTranslator::doIt" to "liqRibTranslator::setRenderLayer" 
- code for output shadow/beauty rib moved from "liqRibTranslator::doIt" to "liqRibTranslator::ribOutput" 
- fixed dirmaps usage in Alfred scripts

Liquid 	2.3.5 (ymesh)

- Cross-platform CMAKE support
Source files and directories are rearanged for
compiling liquidmaya with CMAKE from command line on all
platforms

Code for display drivers moved to /src/displayDrivers
Common source files moved to /src/src (this helps to organize file list from directory for CMAKE)
Only liquidBin.cpp, liquidPlug.cpp, liquid.version (and CMakeLists.txt) are in /src.  

Directories shaders, scripts, textures, plugins, previewRibFiles are placed in /lib 

- boost removed from include (it's supposed that boost library is installed in system)

- in liqGlobalHelpers.cpp added a set of functions "liquidGetPlugValue" for different value types and "liquidGetPlugNumElements".
  (The purpose is to reduce and unify code for reading maya atrributes.)  

- Fixed code for trimmed curves on planar nurbs
- added noNormalizeNurbsUV attribute
- fix nurbs UV to match maya textures  (exept non normalize case)
- fix string sanitizeNodeName( const string& name ) on MacOSX 10.6 Maya2011 ( error in replace_all )
- liqMayaRenderView: fix abs for OSX x64 
- fix shader FileBrowser for Maya2011
- fix ConnectControl for TextFieldGrp in Secondary Displays for Maya2011x64
- fix shader browser preview
- relative to project shader and textures pathes

- added dirmaps support in Render Globals and Alfred scripts

- Launch alfred on Win 7 
- using liquidproxy for launch 64-bit liquid bin from 32-bit alfred on windows
- Support RenderLayers overrides for Boolean Attributes Render Globals

- Support coshaders from duran-duboi branch
- Light shaders are treated as instances from liqShaderFactory. liqRibLightData.cpp dosn't need
code for parsing shader parameters 

- Generic ribLib changes:
 -- DisplayChannel RiCall (correct ribLib -> ribOut.cpp)
 -- DisplayChannel output for Generic Lib
 
 - many source files have only cosmetic changes for cleaning code readability

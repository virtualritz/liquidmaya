</p>
<p>Note: Before you begin working with Liquid you have to make sure that the plug-in 
  is loaded correctly, please see the installation instructions. </p>
<p>When Maya starts and Liquid is loaded there should be a new option on the main 
  menu called Liquid - this is Liquid's main menu and where you will most likely 
  access most of it's features. Select the menu and familiarize yourself with 
  the options. </p>
<p>We'll go through rendering a simple scene first. Create a nurbs sphere and 
  make sure it's centered on the view, now create a directional light and check 
  to make sure the sphere is catching some of the light. Choose preview under 
  the liquid menu and wait for it to render. You should see the ball lit as you 
  would expect when the render is complete. </p>
<p> To add a better looking surface or shader to your sphere you'll have to use 
  Fluid. Under the Liquid menu choose Fluid and a new window will pop up. Fluid 
  is Liquid's shader tool, used for assigning and editing a shaders parameters 
  in the scene. On the left side of the window is a list of all the current shaders 
  in the scene, on the right a file browser. Use the browser to find the shader 
  that you want to load and either right click on the file and choose load or 
  double click on it. An instance of the shader should now appear on the left 
  side of the Fluid window. Right click on the instances name and a menu will 
  appear, these are the various operations you can perform on the shaders. Select 
  the sphere and choose assign from the menu. Preview the scene again to see the 
  changes, the sphere should have your shader attached. </p>

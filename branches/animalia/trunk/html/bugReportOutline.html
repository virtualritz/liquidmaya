<b><u><font size=+3>Liquid: Bug Report Outline</font></u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a quick document to describe how liquid bugs
( let's hope there isn't to many ), liquid core development suggestions
( the way the output works, certain features ) and liquid UI/Design suggestions
( interface, workflow ) are to be submitted.
<p><b><font color="#666666"><font size=+1>Overview</font></font></b>
<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid is a toolset to be used with maya and rendermen to 
  ease the pipeline between the two with various layers defining the tools.&nbsp; 
  There is the core code - which is the actual exporter and "workhorse" of the 
  tool, and there is the UI/Design code - dealing with the UI, interface and workflow.&nbsp; 
  The goal of liquid was to seperate the two as much as posible leading to a level 
  of customizability that allows the user to work in the most effecient manner.&nbsp; 
  What liquid's UI/Design code trys to do is supply the tools needed to develop 
  this workflow as well as give a base interface to develop on top of.&nbsp; With 
  that said - during development there are aspects of the code that need defining 
  by the users which is where reports come in.&nbsp; Reports are like templates 
  that allow the author to manage these requests and make sure everything makes 
  it into upcoming releases.&nbsp; The last form of a report is the Bug report 
  - which deals with elements that cause Liquid to behave in an unexpected way. 
<p><b><font color="#666666"><font size=+1>Core Development Suggestions</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid's internal core code is all written in C++
and deals a lot with the actual rib structure output and core level output.&nbsp;
What should be included with these suggestions are things like surface
attribute elements, new geometry support etc.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These should be sent to the <a href="mailto:colin@nomadicmonkey.com">author</a>
with the subject starting with "Liquid Core" and a detailed description
of the feature.
<p><b><font color="#666666"><font size=+1>Ui/Design Suggestions</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquids UI/Workflow is defined mostly with a set
of mel scripts.&nbsp; There is also a set of helper commands developed
for querying renderman shader attributes and assigning them to objects.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be sent to the <a href="mailto:colin@nomadicmonkey.com">author</a> 
  with the subject starting with "Liquid UI" and a detailed description of the 
  feature. 
<p><b><font color="#666666"><font size=+1>BUGS</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bugs are the developers thorn in the side.&nbsp;
These should be logged in a very strict manner and the template should
be followed.&nbsp; Please log all Liquid bugs by sending them to the author
in this manner
<p><u>Status:</u> status - this should be "Logged"
<br><u>Priority:</u> priority level - how soon this needs to be fixed,
please really consider this strongly, if it's something small that can
easily be worked around make this low, if it's something that isn't affecting
getting a shot done but you'd like it to be done asap then set it to medium
and if it's something that really needs to get done and it's holding up
all production make it high.
<br><u>Bug:</u> a detailed description of the bug
<br><u>Reported By:</u> your name and email address
<br><u>Possibilities:</u> possible reasons why it may be happening
<br><u>Reproducable:</u> Yes or No if it's reproducable
<p> A bug is defined as a feature that is acting unexpectedly. <br>

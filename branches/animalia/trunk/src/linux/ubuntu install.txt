to compile on ubuntu 8.01, Maya 2009, do the following:

install these packages:
mesa-common-dev
libxt-dev
freeglut3-dev
libbz2-dev
zlib1g-dev
libc6-dev-i386
g++-4.1


in my case, installed 3Delight

I had to do some modifications to the file commondefs.mk:

- the LIQRMANLIBS var did point to the correct location of lib3delight.so, however the compiler in my case was not recognizing .so but rather looks for .a files so I just added the full path

- source .liquid_bash to set your environment vars
- compile the liquid shaders

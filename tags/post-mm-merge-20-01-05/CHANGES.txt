1.6.7

- George Harker: fix LIQDEBUGPRINTF for OSX
	swapped final fallback for temp location,
	had windows and nonwindows cases swapped
	Mixed line ending issues - (lots of)

1.6.6 (not on sourceforge):

- Yuri Meshalkin: Support for creases/corners/holes on subdivison meshes
    including a nice Subdivision Surface Inspector panel    
- Yuri Meshalkin: Support for arbitrary renderer configurations in the Liquid
    Render Globals    
- Yuri Meshalkin: Support for rendering dependent files w/o the need to use a
    Job Script anymore (e.g. shadow passes)
- Moritz: Several different Liquid plug-ins can now be installed on the same
    machine
- Moritz: Added support for certain ray tracing attributes on lights    
- Moritz: RIB & display filename from the Liquid Render Globals is handled more
    logical now (hopefully):
    - The scene's name is used as the display name if the latter was omitted
    - The display name is never used as the RIB basename
    - The RIB basename is used as the display name if the latter was omitted
    - The scene's name is used as the RIB basename if the latter was omitted    
- Moritz: Pathnames are now santized everywhere in the RIB
- Moritz: Fixed a bug that caused motion blur to be switched off randomly
    (Thx for reporting & providing a Maya scene exposing it go to Christopher)


1.6.5 (not on sourceforge):

- Rob Pieke: New code for correct handling of particle motion blur
- Moritz: Fixed a bad memory handling bug that led to crashes with the improved
    uv code on subdivs and polygon-/subdivision meshes
- Moritz: RIB size improvements (smaller RIBs):
    - Liquid now uses RIB inline parameter declarations only
    - Support of 3Delight's more compact "sphere"-type RiPoint particles
- Moritz: RIB Attribute support through a new 'Attributes' pop-up in the Liquid
    menu and a new 'Liquid' roll-out in Maya's Attribute Editor
- Moritz: Trace set membership support through a new 'Set Attributes' pop-up in
    the Liquid menu and a new 'Liquid' roll-out for objectSets in Maya's
    Attribute Editor
- Moritz: Buffed up Maya lights support. Point-, distant- and spotlights now
    use a liquid* variant of the resp. shader. Most Maya light attributes are
    handled as a user would expect (particularly Decay)
- Moritz: New Liquid global 'Shutter Config'. Allows to choose if the shutter
    opens on frame, is centered on frame, is centered between frames or closes
    on the next frame (do I hear someone bitch about not enough shutter
    configurations? ;>)
- Moritz: Lights too can now have ray tracing attributes attached through the
    Light menu


1.6.4 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Added new Liquid global "Output Mesh UVs" to control writing of
    redundant uv data to RIBs
- Moritz: Fixed uv code for Maya subdivision surfaces
- Moritz: Switched uv interpolation scheme for 3Delight from "facevarying" to
    "facevertex" -- this should solve all uv warping/interpolation problems on
    subdivsion surfaces
- Moritz: Added default behaviour for undefined shader searchpath and added
    default shader searchpath to the searchpath written to the RIB


1.6.3 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Added new options to and buffed up Liquid's shader preview
- Moritz: Moved Fluid options to their own tab in the Liquid Render Globals
- Moritz: Minor bugfixes in Liquid's curve code
- Moritz: Added code to support curves in 3Delight


1.6.2 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Liquid now automatically substitutes backslashes on Windows in
    Fluid's file chooser dialog
- Moritz: Merged-in Rob Pieké's & George Harker's latest additions which
    inlcude:
    - full sprite particle support
    - full Pixie support
    - OSX support
- Moritz: Added new Liquid global to control output of shaders in deep shadow
    passes
- Moritz: Fixed initialization and cleanup code to account for more than five
    motion samples


1.6.1-5 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Deactivated the code in liquidReAttachParams.mel that led to flushing
    of string paramater values on shader reload in Fluid
- Cedric Paille: Fixed Maya Subdivision Surface code -- Maya subdivs now work,
    including Maya's creasing system. Hardness is ignored, this is a limitation
    of the Maya API
    Moritz: Creased edges and vertices are written with a hardness of 6.0 now
      -- this gives a nice, subtle bevel and ensures that surfaces are still
      tangent continous at creases


1.6.1-4 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: light linking is no longer (erratically) written out in a shadow pass
- Moritz: lights and light linking can now be written out in a deep shadow pass
    if the "Output Lightsources" in the "Deep Shadow Maps" rollout of the
    Liquid Render Globals is checked
- Moritz: added full support (and new Liquid global) for relative pathnames;
    RIBs, archives, the job script etc. now all contain relative pathnames if
    this option is switched on
- Moritz: added command line support for rendering sequences to the dojob.py
    Python script


1.6.1-3 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Added simple MEL parameter expression scripting valid in all liquid
    string input fields; syntax:
    [MEL code]
    square brackets must be escaped, e.g.:
    [getAttr myobj.userArray\[3\]]
    (CURRENTLY DEACTIVATED, NEEDS SOME FIXING IN THE PARSER!!!)
- Moritz: Fixed uninitialized string array bug with blobbies; blobbies code
    activated -- blobbies now actually work
- Moritz: Replaced all if(debug... code with LIQDEBUGPRINTF(...
    Todo: Check if this works everywhere
- Moritz: Fixed Motion Samples glitch; now the maximum number of motion
    samples is defined in liquid.h:
    LIQMAXMOTIONSAMPLES 16
    There's also a bounds check done against this, when the resp. Liquid global
    is read, so no array out of bounds crash happens anymore when a user
    specifies a value greater than this in the Liquid globals
- Moritz: replaced 'endl' with 'std::endl' in liqRenderScript.h to solve endl
    problem on win32
- Moritz: Added quotes to render script filename in win32 build
- Moritz: Added binary RIB output support for 3Delight
- Moritz: Added deep shadow support for 3Delight's "dsm" driver
- Moritz: Changed Opacity to be a color instead of a float


1.6.1-2 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Fixed __Pref bug with subdiv-/polygon meshes; __Pref was not
    initialized correctly and hence never got written out correctly to the RIB
- Olivier Paquet: fixed buffer overflow bug with subdivs that have
    "interpolateboundary" checked
- Moritz: Fixed shader preview in Fluid


1.6.1 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Displacement bounds are now explicitly specified in "shader" space;
    there's no way to currently change this; maybe add another Liquid global?
- Moritz: Added new Liquid global: compiledShaderExt; can be set to e.g. "sdl"
    for 3Delight or "slo" for PRMan
- Moritz: Liquid now writes out all coordinate systems after the lights but
    before any other stuff in the RIB; previously coordinate systems where
    written out scattered between the other geometry according to the order in
    the Maya Outliner
- Moritz: If a Maya light has raytraced shadows switched on,
    Attribute "light" "string shadows" [ "on" ]
    is now written to the RIB regardless of BMRT being used or not
- Moritz: New attribute liquidInvisible; works as mtorInvisible -- tagged
    objects are ignored by Liquid


1.6:

- Maya 6.0 build
- Maya OSX build
- XML format render script output
- View last RIB/render-script fixed for win32
- Shadow map (including deep shadows) fixes
- Other stuff


1.5.6 (not on sourceforge):

- Moritz: Added quotes to all filenames for win32. Now pathnames with spaces
    will work in bloody Windoze
- Moritz: new Liquid global: preGeom; the contents of this string is written to
    the RIB after lights and coordinate systems, but before geometry
- Moritz: Liquid now understands the mtorSubdiv attribute
- Moritz: /Considerably/ buffed up resp. changed the entire MEL interface;
    changed naming to be more MtoR compatible: added separators and ellipses,
    reordered menus where appropriate and added support for file browser
    dialogs to Fluid string input fields
- Moritz: Removed BMRT tab and options from MEL interface as they are obsolete
    and should be replaced by a new set of raytrace options as e.g. in MtoR
- Moritz: Fixed 3Delight settings in liqDelightRenderer.cpp (almost all where
    wrong)
- Aghiles Kheffache: VC++ project settings to compile Liquid with 3Delight


1.5.5:

- Polygon mesh export overhaul for efficiency and facevarying UVs on subdivs
- Crasher bug in Fluid shader editor fixed
- Many other fixes from the last few months


1.5.2:

- Initial release cleaned up with some minor fixes.


1.0:

- Initial release of the source code for the Liquid Rendering Toolkit

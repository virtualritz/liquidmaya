	To load the shader into maya, you use 

	liquidNewShaderNode( string $fileName ) -

	the function returns a string which is the name of the new shader node and the file name is the name of the .slo file.

	to assign it to an object you'd use 

	liquidAssignShaderNode( string $node, string $shaderNode )

	where $node is the shape that you want to assign it to and $shaderNode is the name of the shader, which is what the above returns.  So say you want to do it all in one go - you'd do:

	string $newShaderNode = `liquidNewShaderNode( "/vol/apps/prman_latest/lib/shaders/plastic.slo" );
	liquidAssignShaderNode( "someShape", $newShaderNode )

	now someShape will have the new shaders assigned.

	C.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid is a tool to bridge the gap between Maya and any 
  Renderman compliant renderer such as Pixar's Photorealistic Renderman and Blue 
  Moon Rendering Tools.&nbsp; The toolset includes a shader editor Fluid, a Maya 
  plug-in Liquid, a command line version of Liquid and various command extensions 
  to Maya's embedded scripting language.&nbsp; Being tightly integrated into Maya's 
  workflow all of Liquid's tool can be scripted the same way as any of Maya's 
  other tools through Expressions and MEL - allowing smooth workflow and faster 
  render times. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid has been designed to be as robust as possible with 
  many hours of full production testing and input from users.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
  document will try to describe all the features of Liquid and give an overall 
  feel to how it works in and out of Maya.
